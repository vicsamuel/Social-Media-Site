## About
This was a culmination of the Django and Python Bootcamp I took from the education website Udemy. Through this course I learned everything from the ground up, first with frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While learning these courses, frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery were covered and tested.

After learning the frontend languages and frameworks, python and the concept of object oriented code was explored. After python was explored the main concept of the course, the Django framework was learned to connect both the front and the backend. 

There are a few different applications that comprise this the entirety of the social media site. The accounts, groups, and posts application are just the base of the application and can be extended upon and the appearance can be built out as well. Overall, I highly recommend this course as it is an excellent introduction into many different coding languages and is an excellent way to learn to code different applications with a hands on approach.
